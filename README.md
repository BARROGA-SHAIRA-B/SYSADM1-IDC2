The GitHub repository serves as a course portfolio, organized into three main folders: First Grading, Midterms, and Finals. Each folder contains three files, representing activities completed during the corresponding grading period. The repository also includes a Reflection file, which provides my personal reflections on the course, and a Portfolio Template file that mirrors the content of the folders in the repository.
