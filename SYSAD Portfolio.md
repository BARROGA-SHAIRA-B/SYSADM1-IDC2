**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I expected this course to be a continuation of our previous subject,
  SERADM, and have similar activities. The course exceeded my
  expectations since, while some activities were similar, we focused more
  on management and learned new topics.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The main topics were learning to use Linux (using commands),
  understanding EULA, and using Git commands. These topics enhanced my
  understanding by providing hands-on experience to practice.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Repetition was the most effective strategy for me. Practicing
  repeatedly helped me retain the course material better.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Creating policies and learning about EULA enhanced my learning. These
  activities were effective because they required attention to detail,
  which shows the importance of clarity in documentation.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How
did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Creating policies was difficult for me because I had to make sure they
  were detailed and covered all necessary aspects. Missing key features
  (e.g. addressing policy violations) could lead to issues. To overcome
  this, I organized and planned before writing the policies, imagined
  myself as the user, and considered the company\'s perspective. This
  taught me the importance of being thorough in problem-solving.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
decision-making?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, the course encouraged critical thinking. When managing, I needed
  to interpret things like response time and CPU utilization to identify
  potential issues. Also, creating EULA required analyzing how it affects
  both the user and the company.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
perspectives did you gain from this course?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I learned to be more observant when managing, organized when planning,
  and thorough when creating solutions or policies. These skills have
  improved my ability to analyze and address scenarios effectively.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
future studies, career, or personal life?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I can use these skills to create detailed documentation where I explain
  observations, propose solutions, and explain why they are necessary.
  These skills can be used in various fields and not just in the IT
  field.
