1. What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet, exceed, or fall short of these expectations?
I expected this course to be a continuation of our previous subject, SERADM, and have similar activities. The course exceeded my expectations since, while some activities were similar, we focused more on management and learned new topics.

2. What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?
The main topics were learning to use Linux (using commands), understanding EULA, and using Git commands. These topics enhanced my understanding by providing hands-on experience to practice.

3. Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course material?
Repetition was the most effective strategy for me. Practicing repeatedly helped me retain the course material better.

4. Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they effective?
Creating policies and learning about EULA enhanced my learning. These activities were effective because they required attention to detail, which shows the importance of clarity in documentation.

5. Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?
Creating policies was difficult for me because I had to make sure they were detailed and covered all necessary aspects. Missing key features (e.g. addressing policy violations) could lead to issues. To overcome this, I organized and planned before writing the policies, imagined myself as the user, and considered the company's perspective. This taught me the importance of being thorough in problem-solving.

6. Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or decision-making?
Yes, the course encouraged critical thinking. When managing, I needed to interpret things like response time and CPU utilization to identify potential issues. Also, creating EULA required analyzing how it affects both the user and the company.

7. Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or perspectives did you gain from this course?
I learned to be more observant when managing, organized when planning, and thorough when creating solutions or policies. These skills have improved my ability to analyze and address scenarios effectively.

8. How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your future studies, career, or personal life?
I can use these skills to create detailed documentation where I explain observations, propose solutions, and explain why they are necessary. These skills can be used in various fields and not just in the IT field.
